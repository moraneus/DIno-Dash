## Features

- **Animated Graphics**: Enjoy smooth, animated sprites that bring our dinosaur to life as it runs across different landscapes. The game features a series of carefully designed frames that simulate walking, jumping, and ducking.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Encounter a variety of obstacles, each with unique graphics and movement patterns that challenge your reflexes.
- **Scrolling Backgrounds**: Immerse yourself in beautifully crafted backgrounds that scroll to create a continuous sense of motion, enhancing the overall game feel.
